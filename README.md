How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first clarifying the problem, then breaking it down into smaller components that can be solved individually. For this project, I started with the idea of creating a functional and engaging 3D scene and then designed it around the specific requirements. I thought about how different elements—objects, lighting, textures, and camera angles—fit together to create a cohesive user experience.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Working on this project strengthened my ability to design with both visual aesthetics and performance in mind. I learned to balance realism and efficiency, deciding where to apply detailed textures and where simpler geometry would suffice. I also practiced documenting design decisions, which is an important skill when working in teams or explaining my work to others.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process:

Start with rough sketches and basic shapes in the scene.

Add textures, lighting, and interactivity.

Test and refine until the scene felt visually compelling and technically stable.

This cycle of designing, testing, and improving allowed me to gradually build toward a finished project without getting stuck on one detail too early.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The habit of breaking problems into smaller parts, iterating, and testing often can be applied to any software project. Whether I’m building a web app, a data visualization, or a more advanced game engine, I can reuse these design principles to keep projects manageable and adaptable.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development by combining planning with experimentation. I like to start with a clear structure, then build incrementally, testing each part as I go. In this project, that meant writing modular code for different objects and reusing functions wherever possible.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I learned how to leverage scene graphs and transformations to manage complex 3D objects. I also experimented with adding lighting effects and textures to make the scene more realistic. Another strategy I applied was version control with GitHub, which helped me track changes and back up my progress.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was central. Each milestone added a new layer—basic geometry, then textures, then lighting, then interactivity. By testing after every addition, I caught issues early and avoided overwhelming debugging sessions.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Early in the course, I focused on just getting things to work. By the final milestone, I was more deliberate about writing clean, modular, and documented code that could be reused or expanded later. I also became more comfortable reading and modifying existing code libraries.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science provides me with problem-solving frameworks and technical skills that can be applied in nearly any industry. Whether I pursue software engineering, data science, or interactive media, these skills are tools I can rely on.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

They gave me a deeper understanding of how abstract math and programming concepts translate into visible, interactive systems. This connection between theory and practice will support me in future courses involving algorithms, physics simulations, and user interface design.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In a professional context, these skills help me create engaging user interfaces, data visualizations, or interactive applications. Employers value the ability to make complex information more accessible and visually appealing, and this project demonstrates that I can bridge the gap between technical implementation and user experience.
